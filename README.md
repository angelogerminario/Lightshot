# Lightshot

![cover image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelogerminario/Lightshot/refs/heads/main/coverimage.jpg)

A simple, fast photo culling app I built for myself because I didn't want to pay for expensive culling software. Built in a day using Flutter, it's designed to be faster than macOS Finder when working with RAW files (Sony ARW and Nikon NEF supported).

## What it Does

- Shows high-resolution previews of the images
- Is faster than mac os finder
- Lets you easily select what to export
- Is fast

## Requirements

- macOS 10.14.6 (Mojave) or later

## Development Setup

If you want to run this yourself:

1. Make sure you have Flutter installed
2. Clone the repo and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Notes

- This is a personal project built for my own use
- It's deliberately simple and focused on one task
- No fancy features, just fast photo culling
- Does exactly what i needed and nothing more

## Contributing

This is a personal utility I built for myself, but if you have ideas for improvements pull requests are welcome
